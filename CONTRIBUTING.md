You want to contribute to our wonderful project?
We will accept any kind of help with pleasure!

You should just resped those guidelines:

1. Do not add any dependencies (modules, in case of dependency you write yourself, it's oki), if needed ask first explaining why we should add this module to the project.
2. Respect our code style, use the same prettier/eslint rules, or stricter one.
3. You should always justify any change, and think to comment as much possible.
4. You must not do any troll PR!
5. You shouldn't delete any functions/commands except with a good justification, we will accept only new functionality.
6. It's preferable to do a pull request per new functionality, or everything in the PR should be linked.
7. The main dev (actually GwenBebe, Mattis6666 and Naia-love) can refuse any PR for any reason.
