If you would like to contribute, we will accept any kind of help with pleasure!

You should just respect those guidelines:

1. Do not add any dependencies without good reasoning.
2. Respect our code style and follow the eslint and prettier rules that are already set up.
3. You should always explain any change, and leave comments on why you think this change matters.
4. You should not remove or alter any functionality without good reasoning.
5. Make one PR per change, not one big PR.
