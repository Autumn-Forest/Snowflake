  You wan't to contribute to our wonderfull project?
  We will accept any kind of help with pleasure!
  
  You should just resped those guidelines:
  1. Do not add any dependencies (modules, in case of dependency you write yourself, it's oki), if needed ask first explaining why we should add this module to the project.
  2. Respect our code style, use the same prettier/eslint rules, or stricter one.
  3. You should always justify any change, and think to comment as much possible.
  4. You must not do any troll PR!
  5. You shouldn't delete any functions/commands exept with a good justification, we will acept only new functionnality.
  6. It's prefferable to do a pull request per new functionnality, or everything in the PR should be linked.
  7. The main dev (actually GwenBebe, Mattis6666 and Naia-love) can refuse any PR for any reason.
